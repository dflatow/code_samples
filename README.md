# Code Samples

This repository contains projects that demonstrate my programing experience in a few programing languages.

## Projects
* **TrailblazerProject:** Graph search problems: depth-first, breadth-first, Dijkstra's, A* (C++)
* **LandingPageChallenge:** Exploritory data analysis of an A/B test gone awry (Python, Pandas, iPython notebook)
* **VaryingCoefficientmodel:**  Basis expansion using natural cubic splines to smooth time-varying coefficients (R)
* **PortfolioRebalancing:** Convex optimization applied to multi-period portfolio optimization (Python, cvxpy)
